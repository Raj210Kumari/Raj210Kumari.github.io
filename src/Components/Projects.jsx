    <h1>About</h1>
        I would like to begin by drawing your attention to the title of this
        lecture: "Religious Belief and Public Morality: A Catholic Governor's
        Perspective." I was not invited to speak on "Church and State"
        generally. Certainly not "Mondale vs. Reagan." The subject assigned is
        difficult enough. I will try not to do more than I've been asked. It's
        not easy to stay contained. Certainly, although everybody talks about a
        wall of separation between church and state, I've seen religious leaders
        scale that wall with all the dexterity of olympic athletes. In fact,
        I've seen so many candidates in churches and synagogues that I think we
        should change election day from Tuesdays to Saturdays and Sundays. I am
        honored by this invitation, but the record shows that I am not the first
        Governor of New York to appear at an event involving Notre Dame. One of
        my great predecessors, Al Smith, went to the Army - Notre Dame football
        game each time it was played in New York. His fellow Catholics expected
        Smith to sit with Notre Dame; protocol required him to sit with Army
        because it was the home team. Protocol prevailed. But not without Smith
        noting the dual demands on his affections. "I'll take my seat with
        Army," he said, "but I commend my soul to Notre Dame!"
